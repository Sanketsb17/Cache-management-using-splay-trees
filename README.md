# Splay Tree Cache Management

This project implements a cache management system using Splay Trees. It allows efficient retrieval, insertion, and eviction of key-value pairs based on the least recently used (LRU) policy.

## Features

- Cache with a fixed capacity
- Efficient retrieval of values based on keys
- Insertion of new key-value pairs
- Eviction of the least recently used entry when the cache is full

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

- C++ compiler supporting C++11 or higher
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- `ctime` library for timestamp management

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.

2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.

3. Run the compiled executable.

## Usage

The program provides a command-line interface for interacting with the cache. It supports the following operations:

1. Add an entry: Allows you to add a new key-value pair to the cache.

2. Retrieve an entry: Retrieves the value associated with a given key from the cache.

3. Remove an entry: Removes a key-value pair from the cache.

4. Print cache contents: Displays the current contents of the cache.

5. Exit: Terminates the program.

Follow the on-screen instructions to perform these operations.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.

## Acknowledgements

The implementation of the Splay Tree data structure used in this project is based on the principles described in various computer science literature.
